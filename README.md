- The tool only uses the network when entering the application to check the version, otherwise it does not use the network, and does not collect user data at all. You can turn off the network if you do not trust it.

- The reason Tool-Tree is not open source is simply because the application is developed entirely by hand, based on Kr-Script PIO engine.

### See details

- Instruct: **[No-Root](https://zenlua.github.io/Tool-Tree/Guide.html)**

- If you are rooted, give the app root access to the app, so that it can directly go to the path on the screen after decrypting or saving the file.
